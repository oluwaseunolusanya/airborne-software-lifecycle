              <p>Software lifecycle processes are a set of activities defined on a project to develop software product(s).</p>
              <p>The sequencing of these activities and the assignment of responsibilities for them vary from project to project or industry to industry. These processes typical include planning, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.</p>
              <p>The focus of this documentation will be the processes used in development software used in airborne systems and equipment like the engine control system on an aircraft. These are:</p>

              </header>
              <p>The purpose of the software planning process is to define the means of producing software that will satisfy its requirements and provide the level of confidence that is consistent with the software level. Software level in this context is the criticality of the system failure condition resulting from abnormal behaviour of software.</p>
              <p>This process produces the software plans and standards that direct the software development processes and the integral processes. </p>

              </header>
              <p>Software development processes produce one or more levels of software requirements. High-level requirements are produced directly through analysis of system requirements and system architecture. Usually, these high-level requirements are further developed during the software design process, thus producing one or more successive, lower levels of requirements.
              </p>
              <code><strong>NOTE:</strong> It may be required to justify software development processes that produce a single level of requirements</code>

              <p>
                Software verification is a technical assessment of the outputs of the software planning process, software development processes, and the software verification process. The software verification process is applied as defined by the software planning process and the Software Verification Plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Verification is not simply testing. Testing, in general cannot show the absence of errors. 
              </p>
              <code>
                The term "verify" instead of "test" is used to
discuss the software verification process activities which are typically a combination of reviews, analyses, and tests.

              <p>This process includes the activities of configuration identification, change control,
                baseline establishment, and archiving of the software product, including the related
                software life cycle data. The SCM process does not stop when the software product is
                approved by the certification authority, but continues throughout the service life of the
                system or equipment.</p>
                <code>Outputs of this process are recorded in Software Configuration
                  Management Records or in other software life cycle data.</code>

                obtain assurance that objectives are satisfied, deficiencies are detected, evaluated,
                tracked, and resolved, and software product and software life cycle data conform to
                certification requirements.</p>

                The objectives of the certification liaison process are to:
                <ol>
                  a. Establish communication and understanding between the applicant and the
                  certification authority throughout the software life cycle to assist the certification
                  process.
                  b. Gain agreement on the means of compliance through approval of the Plan for
                  Software Aspects of Certification.
                  c. Provide compliance substantiation.
